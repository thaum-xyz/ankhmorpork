# Script used to clean up S3 bucket used by thanos. It iterates over folders in minio S3 bucket and checks if there
# is a file called `meta.json` or `deletion-mark.json`. Based on those files which it performs the following actions:
# - If it finds `deletion-mark.json` it deletes the folder and all folder versions from S3 bucket. This is because
#   thanos compactor already marked this folder as ready for deletion and compactor can leave the folder after is run.
# - If it doesn't find `meta.json` it also removes the folder and all folder versions from S3 bucket. This is because
#   without `meta.json` the folder is not used by thanos and it can be safely removed.
